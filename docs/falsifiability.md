This document describes conditions under which DD would be falsified.

## Critical Failures (Would Collapse Theory)

### FAIL-1: Contradiction in FORCED Chain

**Condition:** A logical contradiction is found in Chain-5 through Chain-8.

**Example:** Proof that Δⁿ = id for some n > 0 without implying Ø.

**Impact:** Total collapse of core derivation.

**Current status:** No contradiction found. Agda proofs compile with 0 postulates.

---

### FAIL-2: Bool Not Forced

**Condition:** Alternative to binary structure shown possible from Ø impossible.

**Impact:** Chain-5 demoted from FORCED.

**Current status:** No counterexample known.

---

### FAIL-3: Δ = Δ(Δ) Denial Valid

**Condition:** Coherent denial of self-application without performative contradiction.

**Impact:** Chain-6 demoted from FORCED.

**Current status:** No valid denial found.

---

## Empirical Failures (Would Break Bridges)

### FAIL-5: Koide Formula Violated

**Condition:** New τ mass measurement breaks Q = 2/3.

**Test:** Belle II high-precision τ mass.

**Impact:** ℤ₃ structure argument fails.

**Current status:** Q = 0.666661 ± 0.000004 (99.999% fit).

---

### FAIL-7: w(z) = -1 Exactly

**Condition:** Dark energy equation of state measured as exactly -1 with high precision.

**Test:** DESI DR2, Euclid, Rubin Observatory.

**Impact:** PRED-Λ3 ruled out.

**Current status:** DESI 2024 hints at w ≠ -1 (2-3σ, inconclusive).

**Timeline:** Definitive test within ~5 years.

---

### FAIL-8: Fourth Generation Found

**Condition:** Discovery of 4th fermion generation.

**Impact:** Anomaly cancellation argument fails.

**Current status:** LHC constraints strong against 4th generation.

---

## Structural Failures (Would Require Major Revision)

### FAIL-4: SU(3) Not Unique

**Condition:** Another gauge group satisfies HYP-G1..G4.

**Impact:** SU(3) derivation fails; becomes one option among many.

**Current status:** No alternative found.

---

### FAIL-6: Fisher ≠ Spacetime

**Condition:** Proof that information geometry cannot equal spacetime geometry.

**Impact:** HYP-F1 fails.

**Current status:** No direct test available.

---

## Meta-Failures

### FAIL-9: DD Admits Everything

**Condition:** Any consistent structure satisfies 0 < Φ < ∞.

**Impact:** UAC criterion vacuous.

**Current status:** Partially ruled out — some structures provably collapse or explode.

---

### FAIL-10: Better Alternative Exists

**Condition:** Simpler framework with same explanatory power.

**Impact:** DD not minimal.

**Current status:** None known.

## Monitoring

| Failure | Test | Timeline |
|---------|------|----------|
| FAIL-5 | Belle II τ mass | Ongoing |
| FAIL-7 | DESI, Euclid, Rubin | 2025-2030 |
| FAIL-8 | LHC high-luminosity | Ongoing |

## What Is NOT Falsification

- Finding errors in auxiliary materials (Part_I..V, code)
- Disagreement with HYP labels
- Alternative interpretations of CONJ claims
- Philosophical objections to axiom
