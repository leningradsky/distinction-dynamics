# Distinction Dynamics: One-Page Overview

## Core Idea

DD starts from a single prohibition: **Ø is impossible** (no-distinction is impossible).

From this, structural necessities follow:
- Binary structure (every distinction creates X and ¬X)
- Self-application (Δ = Δ(Δ) — distinction distinguishes itself)
- Natural numbers (ℕ emerges from composition monoid)
- Critical regime (exponential growth constraints)

## What DD Claims

### FORCED (Logically Necessary)
- Bool, ℕ, category structure
- Critical regime constraints (CR-1 to CR-7)
- Total: 21 claims

### HYP (Hypotheses for Physics)
- Continuum emergence (not derived)
- Fisher metric = distinction geometry
- Gauge invariance, anomaly freedom
- Total: 20 claims

### DERIVED (Given HYP)
- SU(3) uniqueness
- Koide Q = 2/3
- Total: 3 claims

### CONJ (May Be Numerology)
- α = 137 formula
- 3+1 dimensions
- Total: 3 claims

## Key Insight

The entire FORCED chain requires only ℕ (natural numbers).

The continuum (ℝ) is NOT needed for core derivation — only for physics bridges.

## Falsifiability

| Test | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Contradiction in FORCED chain | Total collapse |
| Koide violated (Belle II) | Structure fails |
| w(z) = -1 exactly | Prediction fails |

## What DD Does NOT Claim

- Pure derivation from one axiom (requires ~20 HYP)
- Derivation of all constants
- Quantum gravity resolution
- Consciousness explanation
