# Distinction Dynamics: One-Page Overview

## Core Idea

DD starts from a single prohibition: **Ø is impossible** (no-distinction is impossible).

From this, structural necessities follow (T0-T30):
- Binary structure (every distinction creates X and ¬X)
- Self-application (Δ = Δ(Δ) — distinction distinguishes itself)
- Number systems: ℕ → ℤ → ℚ → ℝ → ℂ (all FORCED by completeness)
- Critical regime (exponential growth constraints)
- Unitary dynamics U(n) (criticality preservation)
- Continuous time t ∈ ℝ (history completeness)
- Hermitian generator H with U(t) = e^{-itH} (Stone's theorem)
- Born rule μ = |ψ|² (unique distinguishability measure)
- Decoherence without collapse (measurement as relative distinguishability)
- Classical emergence (stable fixed points of decoherence)
- d = 3 spatial dimensions (criticality selection)
- Gauge group SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) (elimination proof)
- Cosmological constant Λ > 0 (UAC violation for Λ ≤ 0)
- Gravitational coupling 0 < G < ∞ (local-global consistency)
- Einstein field equations G_μν = 8πG T_μν (Lovelock uniqueness)
- Fermion generations N ≥ 3 (CP violation requirement)

## What DD Claims (T0-T30)

### FORCED (Logically Necessary) — 33 claims
- Bool, ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, ℝ, ℂ, category structure
- Critical regime constraints (T10)
- Unitary dynamics U(n) (T8)
- Hermitian generator H (T9)
- Born rule (T11)
- Λ > 0 (T27)
- 0 < G < ∞ (T28)
- N_gen ≥ 3 (T30)

### DERIVED (From FORCED Chain) — 18 claims
- Decoherence (T12)
- Classical emergence (T13)
- Space manifold (T14)
- Time uniqueness (T15)
- Energy = H (T16)
- d = 3 (T17)
- Gauge group SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) (T22)
- Einstein equations (T29)
- Koide Q = 2/3 (geometric invariant)

### CONJ (May Be Numerology) — 3 claims
- 1/α = 137 formula (CONJ-A1)
- θ ≈ 2/9 (CONJ-K2)
- sin²θ_W = 3/8 (HYP-K3)

### Other
- DEF: 9 (definitions/conventions)
- CIRC: 1 (CIRC-2 only; CIRC-1 broken by T30)
- PRED: 1 (w(z) ≠ -1)

**Note (T26):** HYP category has been **eliminated**. Per DD-NoAlt, there are no ontological alternatives.

## Key Insight

Per DD-NoAlt (T26): Physics is not derived because it's "true" — it's the only structure that doesn't violate UAC. There are no alternatives.

**FORCED ≠ SELECTED**: DD does not claim values are "chosen" from options. DD claims alternatives are impossible.

## Falsifiability

| Test | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Contradiction in FORCED chain | Total collapse |
| Koide violated (Belle II) | Structure fails |
| w(z) = -1 exactly | Prediction fails |
| Fourth generation found | T30 requires extension |
