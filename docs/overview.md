# Distinction Dynamics: One-Page Overview

## Core Idea

DD starts from a single prohibition: **Ø is impossible** (no-distinction is impossible).

From this, structural necessities follow:
- Binary structure (every distinction creates X and ¬X)
- Self-application (Δ = Δ(Δ) — distinction distinguishes itself)
- Number systems: ℕ → ℤ → ℚ → ℝ → ℂ (all FORCED by criticality)
- Critical regime (exponential growth constraints)
- Unitary dynamics U(n) (criticality preservation)
- Continuous time t ∈ ℝ (history completeness)
- Hermitian generator H with U(t) = e^{-itH} (Stone's theorem)
- Born rule μ = |ψ|² (unique distinguishability measure)
- Decoherence without collapse (measurement as relative distinguishability)
- Classical emergence (stable fixed points of decoherence)

## What DD Claims

### FORCED (Logically Necessary)
- Bool, ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, ℝ, ℂ, category structure
- Critical regime constraints (CR-1 to CR-7)
- Unitary dynamics U(n) (DD-Unitarity theorem)
- Continuous time t ∈ ℝ (DD-Time theorem)
- Hermitian generator H (DD-Generator theorem)
- Total: 28 claims

### HYP (Hypotheses for Physics)
- Fisher metric = distinction geometry
- Gauge invariance, anomaly freedom
- Spacetime identification
- Total: 18 claims

### DERIVED (From FORCED Structure)
- Born rule μ = |ψ|² (DD-Born theorem)
- Decoherence without collapse (DD-Decoherence theorem)
- Classical emergence (DD-Classicality theorem)
- Space (manifold structure) (DD-Space theorem)
- Time uniqueness, signature (1,d-1) (DD-Time-Unique theorem)
- SU(3) uniqueness (given gauge HYP)
- Koide Q = 2/3
- Total: 8 claims

### CONJ (May Be Numerology)
- α = 137 formula
- 3+1 dimensions
- Total: 3 claims

## Key Insight

The FORCED chain derives the complete number tower ℕ → ℤ → ℚ → ℝ → ℂ from criticality alone.

Continuum (ℝ), complex numbers (ℂ), unitary dynamics U(n), continuous time, Hermitian generator H, and Born rule are all FORCED/DERIVED — not hypotheses.

**Physics is not derived because it's not an axiom. It's the only stable regime of history distinguishability.**

This is complete QM kinematics derived without physics postulates.

## Falsifiability

| Test | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Contradiction in FORCED chain | Total collapse |
| Koide violated (Belle II) | Structure fails |
| w(z) = -1 exactly | Prediction fails |
