# Reading Path: 60-Minute Critical Review

## Goal

Understand DD's structure and identify weak points in under an hour.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (15 minutes)

### 1.1 The Primitive (5 min)
**Read:** [0_CORE/AXIOM.md](../0_CORE/AXIOM.md)

**Key question:** Is "Ø is impossible" meaningful and non-trivial?

### 1.2 Definitions (5 min)
**Read:** [0_CORE/DEFINITIONS.md](../0_CORE/DEFINITIONS.md)

**Key question:** Are Σ, A, ≼, C well-defined?

### 1.3 UAC (5 min)
**Read:** [0_CORE/UAC.md](../0_CORE/UAC.md)

**Key question:** Does 0 < Φ < ∞ follow from structure, or is it imposed?

---

## Phase 2: FORCED Chain (20 minutes)

### 2.1 Complete Derivation (15 min)
**Read:** [1_DERIVATION/FORCED_SPINE.md](../1_DERIVATION/FORCED_SPINE.md)

**Focus on:**
- T4: Does irreversibility argument work?
- T7: Is ℝ genuinely forced by completeness?
- T11: Is Born rule unique?
- T26: Is DD-NoAlt (no alternatives) valid?
- T30: Does CP violation force N ≥ 3?

### 2.2 Dependency Structure (5 min)
**Skim:** [1_DERIVATION/DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md](../1_DERIVATION/DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md)

**Key question:** Are T0-T30 dependencies valid?

---

## Phase 3: Remaining Items (10 minutes)

### 3.1 Conjectures (5 min)
**Read:** [2_EXPRESSION/BRIDGES.md](../2_EXPRESSION/BRIDGES.md)

**Key question:** Are CONJ claims (α=137, θ≈2/9) structure or numerology?

### 3.2 Circularities (5 min)
**Read:** [2_EXPRESSION/CIRCULARITIES.md](../2_EXPRESSION/CIRCULARITIES.md)

**Key question:** Is CIRC-2 (Triad ⟷ Rank) problematic?

**Note:** CIRC-1 (SU(3) ⟷ generations) has been BROKEN by T30.

---

## Phase 4: Audit (15 minutes)

### 4.1 Failure Modes (5 min)
**Read:** [6_AUDITS/failure_modes.md](../6_AUDITS/failure_modes.md)

**Key question:** Are falsification conditions genuine?

### 4.2 Known Objections (5 min)
**Read:** [6_AUDITS/known_objections.md](../6_AUDITS/known_objections.md)

**Key question:** Are responses adequate?

### 4.3 Master Status (5 min)
**Read:** [3_STATUS/STATUS.md](../3_STATUS/STATUS.md)

**Key question:** Is labeling consistent throughout?

---

## After Review: Key Questions

1. **Is T4 valid?** Does irreversibility really follow from Ø impossible?

2. **Is T26 (DD-NoAlt) legitimate?** Can alternatives really be eliminated?

3. **Is T30 correct?** Does CP violation genuinely require ℂ³?

4. **Is α = 137 numerology?** What would distinguish structure from coincidence?

5. **What does DD actually achieve?** Complete derivation or constraint framework?
