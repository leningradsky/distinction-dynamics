# Reading Path: 60-Minute Critical Review

## Goal

Understand DD's structure and identify weak points in under an hour.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (15 minutes)

### 1.1 The Primitive (5 min)
**Read:** [0_CORE/AXIOM.md](../0_CORE/AXIOM.md)

**Key question:** Is "Ø is impossible" meaningful and non-trivial?

### 1.2 Definitions (5 min)
**Read:** [0_CORE/DEFINITIONS.md](../0_CORE/DEFINITIONS.md)

**Key question:** Are Σ, A, ≼, C well-defined?

### 1.3 UAC (5 min)
**Read:** [0_CORE/UAC.md](../0_CORE/UAC.md)

**Key question:** Does 0 < Φ < ∞ follow from structure, or is it imposed?

---

## Phase 2: FORCED Chain (15 minutes)

### 2.1 Core Chain (10 min)
**Read:** [1_DERIVATION/FORCED_CHAIN.md](../1_DERIVATION/FORCED_CHAIN.md)

**Focus on:**
- Chain-6: Is Δ = Δ(Δ) valid?
- Chain-7: Does irreversibility argument work?
- Chain-8: Is ℕ ≅ {Δⁿ} justified?

### 2.2 Critical Regime (5 min)
**Skim:** [1_DERIVATION/CRITICAL_REGIME.md](../1_DERIVATION/CRITICAL_REGIME.md)

**Key question:** Do CR-1 to CR-7 follow from UAC?

---

## Phase 3: Bridges (15 minutes)

### 3.1 HYP Analysis (10 min)
**Read:** [2_EXPRESSION/BRIDGES.md](../2_EXPRESSION/BRIDGES.md)

**Key question:** Are the hypotheses:
- Independent or redundant?
- Justified or ad hoc?
- Falsifiable?

### 3.2 Circularities (5 min)
**Read:** [2_EXPRESSION/CIRCULARITIES.md](../2_EXPRESSION/CIRCULARITIES.md)

**Key question:** Are CIRC-1 and CIRC-2 acknowledged or hidden?

---

## Phase 4: Audit (15 minutes)

### 4.1 Failure Modes (5 min)
**Read:** [6_AUDITS/failure_modes.md](../6_AUDITS/failure_modes.md)

**Key question:** Are falsification conditions genuine?

### 4.2 Known Objections (5 min)
**Read:** [6_AUDITS/known_objections.md](../6_AUDITS/known_objections.md)

**Key question:** Are responses adequate?

### 4.3 Master Status (5 min)
**Read:** [3_STATUS/STATUS.md](../3_STATUS/STATUS.md)

**Key question:** Is labeling consistent throughout?

---

## After Review: Key Questions

1. **Is Chain-7 valid?** Does irreversibility really follow from Ø impossible?

2. **Are HYP bridges justified?** Or are they just physics assumptions with DD labels?

3. **Is α = 137 numerology?** What would distinguish structure from coincidence?

4. **What does DD actually achieve?** Constraint framework or physics derivation?
