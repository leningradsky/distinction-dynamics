## Foundational Questions

### Q: "Ø is impossible" is trivial/empty

**A:** The prohibition is not trivial — it uniquely constrains structure. From it, binary partition, self-application, and natural numbers follow. A trivial axiom would not force specific structure.

---

### Q: Self-application Δ = Δ(Δ) is circular

**A:** It's not circular — it's transcendental. Denying "distinction distinguishes itself" requires using distinction, making denial performatively self-refuting. This is the same structure as cogito ergo sum.

---

### Q: The definitions are arbitrary choices

**A:** The definitions (Σ, A, ≼, C) are minimal formalizations of "finite sequences of marks with prefix ordering." Alternative formalizations would be isomorphic. The choices are not arbitrary but conventional.

## Physics Questions

### Q: Too many hypotheses for "derivation"

**A:** Partially correct. DD claims:
- 28 FORCED results from axiom (including ℕ → ℤ → ℚ → ℝ → ℂ, U(n), continuous time, Hermitian generator H)
- 18 HYP bridges to physics (explicitly labeled)
- Compatibility, not pure derivation

The value is explicit labeling, not hidden assumptions. The FORCED chain now derives complete QM kinematics without physics postulates.

---

### Q: The continuum isn't derived

**A:** This has been resolved. The continuum (ℝ) is now FORCED via Chain-9,10,11:
- ℤ: forced by iteration comparison (signed differences)
- ℚ: forced by commensurability (ratio comparison)
- ℝ: forced by limit closure (Cauchy completeness required by criticality)

HYP-C1 is now SUPERSEDED. GAP-2 is closed.

---

### Q: Time isn't derived

**A:** This has been resolved. Continuous time t ∈ ℝ is now FORCED via DD-Time theorem:
- ℤ fails: discrete jumps violate critical distinguishability
- ℚ fails: incomplete → histories "fall out" at irrational limits
- ℝ: unique connected, complete, ordered abelian group

HYP-F2 is now SUPERSEDED. GAP-3 is closed.

---

### Q: α = 137 is numerology

**A:** Possibly. That's why it's labeled CONJ-A1, not FORCED or DERIVED. The formula 1/α = 11² + 4² has 99.97% empirical fit but no derivation of why this specific decomposition. It may be coincidence.

---

### Q: 3+1 dimensions isn't derived

**A:** Correct. HYP-S1 was downgraded to CONJ because the argument (triad → 3 spatial dimensions) is weak. SU(3) has rank 2, not 3. This is acknowledged as gap (GAP-6).

---

## Methodological Questions

### Q: DD is unfalsifiable

**A:** False. See [docs/falsifiability.md](falsifiability.md). Key tests:
- PRED-Λ3: w(z) ≠ -1 (testable by DESI, Euclid)
- FAIL-5: Koide violation (testable by Belle II)
- FAIL-8: 4th generation (testable by LHC)

---

### Q: DD is not a Theory of Everything

**A:** Correct. DD explicitly disclaims TOE status. It's a constraint framework showing compatibility with physics, not a derivation of all physics.

---

### Q: What's the point if it doesn't derive everything?

**A:** The point is:
1. Explicit labeling of what is forced vs assumed
2. Structural constraints (critical regime)
3. Compatibility checks
4. Testable predictions
5. Framework for organizing physics claims

Most physics theories have hidden assumptions. DD makes them explicit.

## Technical Questions

### Q: Why Agda/Lean/Coq?

**A:** Proof assistants verify logical consistency. Agda proofs compile with 0 postulates, meaning the FORCED chain is formally verified.

---

### Q: What about the 31 LaTeX chapters?

**A:** They are unaudited legacy material, not part of the formal spine. They may contain stronger claims than the spine justifies. Use 0_CORE/, 1_DERIVATION/, 2_EXPRESSION/ for authoritative content.

---

### Q: How do I contribute?

**A:** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md). Key rule: all claims must be labeled.
