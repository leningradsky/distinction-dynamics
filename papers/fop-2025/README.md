# Foundations of Physics Submission (January 2025)

## Submission Package

| File | Description | Pages |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `realisability_sm.tex/pdf` | **Main paper**: Realisability Constraints and the Emergence of Standard Model Structure | 16 |
| `dd_constraint_theory.tex/pdf` | **Companion paper**: Distinction Dynamics as Constraint Theory | 12 |
| `cover_letter_fop.tex/pdf` | Cover letter for FoP submission | 2 |
| `response_to_referees.tex/pdf` | Pre-prepared response to anticipated referee concerns | 4 |
| `realisability_axiom.tex/pdf` | Philosophical axiom note (separate, for context) | 3 |

## Key Claims

1. **Logical unification**: Connects quantum reconstruction theorems, Hurwitz bound, anomaly cancellation, and gauge-algebra correspondences into single derivation chain

2. **Saturation theorem**: Standard Model saturates realisable space—extensions violate realisability or are merely effective

3. **Three generations**: Within Gresnigt realisation class, N_gen = 3 follows from Hurwitz bound + CP violation requirement

## Status

- All overclaims removed or scoped with explicit conditions
- Theorems either purely mathematical or explicitly conditional
- Philosophical content moved to separate axiom note
- Definition 6.1 (Realisability) stated as pure mathematics: normed division algebra axioms (R1)-(R3)

## Submission Strategy

1. **arXiv**: hep-th (primary) + quant-ph (cross-list)
2. **FoP**: Submit via Editorial Manager with cover letter
3. **Response**: Hold in reserve for R&R

## Version

- **Date**: 2025-01-01
- **Status**: Ready for submission
