# Critical Regime: Structural Requirements for 0 < Φ < ∞

---

## Context

From UAC (`0_CORE/UAC.md`):
- Admissible structures satisfy 0 < Φ < ∞
- Φ = lim sup (1/n) log P(n) where P(n) = distinguishable paths of length n

**Question:** What structural constraints does 0 < Φ < ∞ impose?

---

## Theorem: Characterization of Critical Regime

**Statement:** A structure S has 0 < Φ(S) < ∞ iff S has:

1. **Finite local branching** (upper bound on Φ)
2. **Non-trivial composition** (lower bound on Φ)

**Status:** FORCED (structural necessity from UAC)

---

## Part 1: Upper Bound (Φ < ∞)

### Lemma (Finite Local Branching)

If Φ(S) < ∞, then S has bounded local valence.

**Proof:**

Let d(v) = number of outgoing transitions from state/object v.

If sup_v d(v) = ∞, then paths of length n can grow as:
```
P(n) ≥ d_max^n → ∞ superexponentially if d_max grows with n
```

For Φ < ∞, we need:
```
P(n) ≤ C · e^(Φ·n) for some C, Φ < ∞
```

This requires:
```
sup_v d(v) < ∞
```

**Status:** FORCED

---

### Corollary (Finite Generator Set)

Any admissible structure is generated by a finite set of local transitions.

**Proof:** Bounded local valence + countable reachability → finite generator set up to equivalence.

**Status:** FORCED

---

## Part 2: Lower Bound (Φ > 0)

### Lemma (Non-Polynomial Growth)

If Φ(S) > 0, then P(n) grows faster than any polynomial.

**Proof:**

If P(n) = O(n^k) for some k, then:
```
Φ = lim sup (1/n) log(n^k) = lim sup (k log n)/n = 0
```

Therefore Φ > 0 requires superpolynomial growth.

**Status:** FORCED

---

### Lemma (Non-Commutativity or Branching)

Superpolynomial growth requires either:
1. Non-commutative composition, or
2. Genuine branching (multiple distinct continuations)

**Proof:**

Commutative + linear (no branching) → P(n) = O(n^k) for dimension k.

Example: ℤ^k has polynomial growth ~ n^k.

Exponential growth requires "new directions" at each step that don't collapse.

**Status:** FORCED

---

## Part 3: The Critical Class

### Definition (Critical Structure)

A structure S is **critical** iff 0 < Φ(S) < ∞.

Equivalently: exponential path growth, neither collapsing nor exploding.

---

### Examples

| Structure | P(n) | Φ | Status |
|-----------|------|---|--------|
| Trivial (one state) | 1 | 0 | Collapse |
| ℤ^k (commutative) | O(n^k) | 0 | Collapse |
| Free monoid on d letters | d^n | log d | **Critical** |
| Free group F_k (k ≥ 2) | (2k-1)^n | log(2k-1) | **Critical** |
| Unrestricted composition | ≥ n! | ∞ | Explosion |

---

### Theorem (Minimal Critical Structure)

The minimal structure with Φ > 0 is:
- At least 2 non-commuting generators
- Finite presentation (finite relations)

**Proof:**

1. Single generator → cyclic → P(n) = n → Φ = 0
2. Two commuting generators → ℤ² → P(n) ~ n² → Φ = 0
3. Two non-commuting generators → free monoid on 2 → P(n) = 2^n → Φ = log 2 > 0

Minimality: removing either generator or adding commutativity → Φ = 0.

**Status:** FORCED

---

## Part 4: Constraints on Generators

### Theorem (Valence Bounds)

For critical structure with Φ = h:
```
2 ≤ d_eff ≤ e^h
```

where d_eff = effective number of independent directions.

**Proof:**

- Lower bound: d_eff ≥ 2 for non-commutativity
- Upper bound: P(n) ≤ d_eff^n → Φ ≤ log(d_eff)

**Status:** FORCED

---

### Corollary (Finite Type)

Critical structures are finitely presented:
- Finite generator set G
- Finite relation set R

Infinite presentation → either collapse (too constrained) or explosion (too free).

**Status:** FORCED (structural, not constructive)

---

## Part 5: Emergence of Symmetry

### Observation

Critical structures naturally have:

1. **Automorphisms**: Permutations of generators preserving relations
2. **Quotients**: Identifying generators modulo relations
3. **Representations**: Faithful actions on vector spaces

These are not added — they emerge from finiteness + non-triviality.

---

### Theorem (Automorphism Group Structure)

If S is critical with d generators, then Aut(S) is:
- Non-trivial (at least generator permutations)
- Finite or compact (bounded by d!)
- Acts faithfully on generator set

**Status:** FORCED (given finite presentation)

---

## Summary: What 0 < Φ < ∞ Forces

| Constraint | Source | Status |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Finite local valence | Φ < ∞ | FORCED |
| Finite generators | Finite valence | FORCED |
| Non-commutativity | Φ > 0 | FORCED |
| ≥ 2 generators | Minimality | FORCED |
| Finite presentation | Criticality | FORCED |
| Automorphism structure | Finite presentation | FORCED |

---

## What This Does Not Force

The following require additional structure (HYP):

| Item | Why Not Forced | Location |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Specific d value | Multiple d give 0 < Φ < ∞ | HYP |
| Continuous structure | Discrete is sufficient | HYP-C1 |
| Specific group (SU(n)) | Multiple groups satisfy constraints | HYP-G1 |
| Spatial interpretation | Algebraic ≠ geometric | HYP-S1 |

## Next Step (Boundary of FORCED)

To determine which specific structures describe physics:
→ Requires bridge hypotheses in `2_EXPRESSION/BRIDGES.md`

The FORCED chain establishes: **physics lives in the critical class**.

It does not establish: **which member of the critical class**.
