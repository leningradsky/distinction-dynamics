## 1. What Is Established (FORCED: T0-T30)

From the sole prohibition (Ø impossible) and formal definitions, the following is strictly derived:

### Core Structure (T0-T13)
- **Binary structure (Bool)** — any distinction generates X / not-X
- **Self-application** — Δ = Δ(Δ)
- **Number systems** — ℕ → ℤ → ℚ → ℝ → ℂ (all FORCED by completeness)
- **Unitary dynamics** — U(n) forced by UAC preservation
- **Hermitian generators** — H forced by continuous U(t)
- **Born rule** — μ = |ψ|² as unique distinguishability measure
- **Decoherence** — subsystem distinguishability without collapse
- **Classical emergence** — stable fixed points of decoherence

### Spacetime (T14-T17)
- **Space manifold** — emerges from classical structure
- **Time uniqueness** — exactly one process parameter
- **Energy** — H ≡ energy (time-conjugate)
- **d = 3** — unique stable dimension by criticality selection

### Gauge Structure (T18-T25)
- **SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)** — unique gauge group by elimination proof
- **Anomaly freedom** — forces specific matter content
- **Confinement** — SU(3) coupling behavior
- **Higgs mechanism** — SSB requirement for massive gauge bosons

### Cosmology (T26-T30)
- **DD-NoAlt** — no ontological alternatives exist
- **Λ > 0** — positive cosmological constant (UAC requires infinite future)
- **0 < G < ∞** — finite gravitational coupling
- **Einstein equations** — G_μν = 8πG T_μν (Lovelock uniqueness)
- **N_gen ≥ 3** — fermion generations from CP violation requirement

**Note (T26):** Per DD-NoAlt, the category HYP has been eliminated. There are no "hypotheses" — what exists is what must exist.

## 2. What DD Claims (Post-T26)

DD asserts:

> Physics is not derived because it's "true" — it's the only structure that doesn't violate UAC. There are no alternatives.

**FORCED ≠ SELECTED**: DD does not claim values are "chosen" from options. DD claims alternatives are impossible.

In other words:

- DD is a **filter of the admissible** — ruling out impossible structures
- It answers not "what exists?" but "what can exist without destroying distinguishability"
- Per DD-NoAlt: the answer is unique

## 3. What Remains Undetermined

### CONJ (Numerical Patterns — May Be Numerology)
- 1/α = 11² + 4² = 137 (CONJ-A1) — 99.97% fit
- θ ≈ 2/9 (CONJ-K2) — ~99% fit
- sin²θ_W = 3/8 (HYP-K3) — poor fit

### CIRC (Remaining Circular Dependency)
- CIRC-2: Triad ⟷ Rank ≥ 2

### PRED (Testable Prediction)
- w(z) ≠ -1 — dark energy evolution

### Specific Numerical Values
DD derives domains (BOUND), not exact values:
- G ∈ (0, ∞) — but not G = 6.674×10⁻¹¹
- Λ > 0 — but not Λ ≈ 10⁻¹²² in Planck units
- N ≥ 3 — but not exactly N = 3

---

## 4. What DD Does Better Than Other Approaches

1. **Separates layers:**
   - FORCED = logical necessity (33 claims)
   - DERIVED = follows from FORCED (18 claims)
   - CONJ = numerical patterns (3 claims)
   - DEF = definitions (9 claims)

2. **Eliminates "hypothesis" as category:**
   Per T26, there are no ontological alternatives — HYP is not a valid status.

3. **Explains "why not otherwise":**
   Alternative structures violate UAC — fundamentally different type of explanation.

4. **Interprets physics as stabilized criticality:**
   The world is the boundary of distinction stability, not maximum or minimum.

## 5. Core Structural Conclusion

The strongest conclusion of DD is not physical, but structural:

> What is realized is not "one possibility among many" — it is the unique structure that withstands self-application of distinguishability.

This simultaneously explains:

- why there is structure, not chaos (Φ > 0)
- why there is evolution, not statics (irreversibility)
- why there are laws (criticality constraints)
- why the world is "not too simple" and "not too complex" (0 < Φ < ∞)

## 6. One-Paragraph Summary

Distinction Dynamics is a derivation framework showing that from the prohibition "Ø is impossible," the complete structure of physics is forced: number systems, quantum mechanics, gauge theory, gravity, and cosmology. Per DD-NoAlt (T26), there are no ontological alternatives — the category HYP has been eliminated. DD does not derive numerical values, but derives structural necessities: SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), d = 3+1, N_gen ≥ 3, Λ > 0, 0 < G < ∞. What was once "hypothesis" is now traced as unique solution to UAC constraints.
