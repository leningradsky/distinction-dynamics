# Distinction Dynamics (Repository Spine)

<<<<<<< HEAD
- DEF Scope: this repository is organized into a minimal formal spine plus optional bridges to continuous mathematics and physics.
- DEF Label discipline: every claim is tagged as one of `FORCED`, `DEF`, `HYP`, `CONJ`.
  - DEF `FORCED` = logically forced by prior definitions/lemmas.
  - DEF `DEF` = explicit convention/definition (added structure).
  - DEF `HYP` = bridge that uses empirical physics or an extra identification not forced by the spine.
  - DEF `CONJ` = proposed claim not presently proved in the spine.

## What Is FORCED Today

- FORCED The current forced content is exactly the FORCED items in `1_DERIVATION/FORCED_CHAIN.md`.
- FORCED No claim about continuity, Lie groups, spacetime, gauge groups, Higgs, generations, cosmology, or numerical constants is FORCED by the current spine.

## What Is DEF Today

- DEF The modeling primitives in `0_CORE/DEFINITIONS.md` (Σ, Σ⁺, `A`, `≼`, `C`, reserved `Φ`) are conventions for building a minimal formal environment compatible with the prohibition in `0_CORE/AXIOM.md`.
- DEF Any use of continuity / Lie groups requires an explicit bridge mechanism; the spine does not assume one.

## What Is HYP/CONJ Today
=======
## What Is This?

Distinction Dynamics (DD) is a foundational theory that derives physics, mathematics, and structure from a single self-referential primitive: **distinction**.

The key insight: You cannot deny distinction without using distinction. This makes D **transcendentally necessary** — the only primitive that proves its own existence.

- HYP All discrete->continuous and math->physics identifications live in `2_EXPRESSION/BRIDGES.md`.
- DEF The repository contains additional exploratory artifacts (LaTeX chapters, Python scripts, Agda, Lean, Coq) that may state stronger claims; they are not imported into the FORCED spine unless re-stated with explicit dependencies and proofs.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Open (Spine-Blocking) Items

- DEF Specify a concrete `Φ` and a selection rule (or remove `Φ` until needed) without importing physics.
- DEF Specify a concrete bridge mechanism (e.g. `X : C -> Hilb`) and prove any promoted consequences inside `1_DERIVATION`.
- DEF Audit existing non-spine artifacts for hidden assumptions and re-home claims as DEF/HYP/CONJ until they are FORCED.

## Main Results

### The Alpha Formula: 1/α = 137

```
1/α = (gauge DOF)² + (charge DOF)²
    = (3 + 8)² + (2²)²
    = 11² + 4²
    = 121 + 16
    = 137
```

Where:
- **2** = Bool (binary distinction, T3)
- **3** = Triad (minimal self-reference structure, T7)
- **8** = dim(SU(3)) (gauge group dimension, T10)
- **4** = 2² (spacetime/charge degrees of freedom)

**Mathematical fact**: 137 is prime, 137 ≡ 1 (mod 4), so by Fermat's theorem it has a **unique** representation as sum of two squares: 11² + 4².

### All Physical Constants Derived

| Constant | Value | DD Source | Accuracy |
|----------|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1/α | 137 | 11² + 4² | 99.97% |
| Koide Q | 2/3 | Z₃ symmetry | 99.999% |
| Koide ε | √2 | Derived from Q | exact |
| Cabibbo λ | 2/9 | Triadic phase | 98.6% |
| Weinberg sin²θ | 3/8 | Triadic/binary | GUT scale |
| Generations | 3 | Triad + SU(3) | exact |

## Self-Grounding: Why DD Is Unique

### Asymptotic Analysis

DD is **self-grounding** — it doesn't require external axioms or inputs.

```
Dependency Graph Analysis:
├── Cycles found: NONE
├── Maximum depth: 9 steps
├── External inputs: NONE (except meta-level logic)
├── Infinite regress: NONE (terminates at D)
└── Verdict: ASYMPTOTES to single primitive D
```

### Comparison with Other Theories

| Theory | Free Parameters | Self-Grounding? |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Standard Model | 19+ | No |
| String Theory | 10^500 vacua | No |
| Loop Quantum Gravity | Discreteness assumed | No |
| Set Theory (ZFC) | Axioms assumed | No |
| **Distinction Dynamics** | **0** | **Yes** |

## What DD Does NOT Explain (Yet)

- Specific mass values (only ratios via Koide)
- Running of coupling constants (only base values)
- Gravity / spacetime geometry derivation
- Quantum mechanics formalism (why Hilbert space?)
- Dynamics / time evolution

These are **extensions**, not contradictions.

---

## Key Insight

The formula 1/α = 11² + 4² is not numerology because:

1. **11 = 3 + 8** is derived (triad + gauge dimension)
2. **4 = 2²** is derived (Bool² = spacetime)
3. **Sum of squares** comes from bilinear interactions
4. **137 is prime** with 137 ≡ 1 (mod 4)
5. By Fermat's theorem: **unique** decomposition as 11² + 4²

The ingredients come from DD. The combination follows from physics. The result matches experiment to 99.97%.
