Ø is impossible.

This repository fixes a single prohibition and explores everything that is forced by it.

Repository structure:
- /0_CORE — immutable foundation
- /1_DERIVATION — forced logical chain
- /2_EXPRESSION — physics, mathematics, code, and experiments

If you believe an alternative is possible, indicate precisely where Ø becomes admissible.
